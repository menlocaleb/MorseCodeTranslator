# MorseCodeTranslator
Many Morse Code related sites already exist, but I felt there was a simple one that composed the full plaintext message as you tapped your message. While other sites might be better to learn Morse Code, this is a fun way to keep up your skills and compose full messages using Morse code.

## TODO
1. Mobile friendly - need button alternative, or hidden text field to bring up keypad
  - Make sure to get rid of mobile tap delay
1. Better UI intro for user
  - "Tap out 4 'dots' in a row" text to get user to start using app
  - Add "Initializing..." plus dot for each tap above text box area
  - Then add "Initialized, start tapping!" when ready to go
  - Also add flashing element so user can remember their beat
1. Add link to Wikipedia, and easy to view table of dots and dashes
  - Add option to hide table if want
1. Add both text and dot and dash output
1. Style to look old-timey, and focus users attention on important bits
1. Test/improve translation and timing
  1. translate only bits that haven't been done yet
  1. Look into min and max tempos allowed
1. Add more customization for timing and strictness on it
1. Maybe visualization of duration of taps compared to ideal?
  - looks like DJ software with scrolling bit on top and then taping is shown
1. autosuggestion? so as doing letter it would narrow down possibilities
1. Auto set time based on testing standards
1. Add way to show "test texts" if they exist
  - becomes automatic test tool
